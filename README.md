# C++ Problem Solving Challenges

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of C++ problem-solving tasks, designed to enhance algorithmic thinking, efficient problem-solving, and mastery of C++ fundamentals. The challenges cover a wide array of topics, including geometry, array manipulation, matrix traversal, and combinatorial logic. Through solving these tasks, we aim to refine coding efficiency, optimize time complexity, and deepen our understanding of core programming concepts.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Geometry & Mathematical Algorithms**:
   - Determining if a triangle is right-angled or almost right-angled based on coordinate points.
   - Use of vector geometry to solve spatial problems.
   - Understanding the Pythagorean theorem and its applications in discrete grid-based problems.

2. **Array Manipulation**:
   - Efficient traversal and manipulation of arrays to find maximum differences under certain conditions.
   - Implementing algorithms with a focus on minimizing time complexity for large datasets.

3. **Matrix Traversal**:
   - Spiral order traversal of a matrix.
   - Handling multi-dimensional arrays and managing boundaries in matrix-based problems.

4. **Combinatorics and Set Theory**:
   - Challenges focused on selecting and manipulating subsets of numbers based on specific constraints.
   - Logic around ensuring that selected numbers follow defined mathematical rules (e.g., sums involving zero digits).

5. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Use of efficient data structures like vectors, maps, and sets.
   - Sorting and searching algorithms to improve performance.

## Core Focuses

- **Efficiency**: Each task focuses on optimizing algorithms to meet strict time and space constraints, often working with large data sets. This reinforces knowledge of time complexity and space-saving techniques.
  
- **Accuracy**: Mathematical precision is vital, especially in geometry-related problems. Careful consideration of edge cases ensures robust solutions.
  
- **Code Readability**: Writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code is a priority, with functions well-separated and logic easy to follow. Comments and clear variable naming help enhance readability.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Geometry Tasks**:
   - **Challenge**: Determine if a triangle is right-angled or can be transformed into a right-angled triangle by shifting one vertex by a distance of 1.
   - **Solution**: A function computes the distances between vertices and checks if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. If not, small adjustments (shifts) to vertices are simulated to check if the triangle can become right-angled.

2. **Array Max Difference**:
   - **Challenge**: For every pair of array elements where one is greater than or equal to the other, calculate the difference in their indices and find the maximum.
   - **Solution**: By maintaining track of the minimum value encountered, and updating the maximum difference dynamically, the problem is solved in linear time (O(n)).

3. **Spiral Matrix Traversal**:
   - **Challenge**: Print the elements of a matrix in spiral order.
   - **Solution**: A boundary-based traversal approach ensures the matrix is traversed layer by layer, minimizing overhead and complexity.

4. **Subset Summation Constraints**:
   - **Challenge**: Choose integers such that any two numbers can be summed, considering specific digit-based restrictions.
   - **Solution**: A set-based approach is used to verify constraints, ensuring the problem is solved efficiently using logical grouping and sorting.

## Problem-Solving Skills

- **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller sub-tasks. This was particularly useful in the geometry problems, where we decomposed the problem into distance calculations and Pythagorean checks.
  
- **Iterative Optimization**: Improving solutions by iterating through different approaches. For instance, moving from brute force solutions to optimized O(n) solutions where appropriate.

- **Edge Case Handling**: A key focus was ensuring robust solutions that account for all edge cases, such as degenerate triangles, minimal matrix sizes, or extreme array values.

## Key Upskilling Merits

- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: All tasks were approached with a focus on reducing time and space complexity, particularly in large dataset problems where brute force solutions would be impractical.
  
- **C++ Mastery**: Tasks helped in reinforcing C++ fundamentals, including the use of standard libraries (`<vector>`, `<map>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.), handling of large integers, and efficient input/output management.

- **Mathematical Insights**: Geometry-based problems highlighted the importance of mathematical reasoning in problem-solving. Problems involving triangles and distances required strong geometric understanding alongside algorithmic logic.

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Future tasks can focus on integrating dynamic programming techniques to solve more complex optimization problems.
  
2. **Graph Algorithms**: Expanding into graph traversal and manipulation algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms) to diversify problem-solving strategies.
  
3. **Parallelism & Concurrency**: Exploring multi-threaded solutions for large data problems could offer insights into handling even more complex, real-world data efficiently.
  
4. **Complex Data Structures**: Incorporating advanced data structures like segment trees, tries, and heaps could be the next step in enhancing algorithmic efficiency.

5. **Unit Testing**: Adding unit tests to each solution will ensure that all edge cases are accounted for and that solutions are robust. This can be a key addition for maintaining the integrity of code in large projects.

## Conclusion
